# Disease-Mesh-Similarity
For each disease, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is constructed based on hierarchical descriptors,  in which nodes represent disease MeSH descriptors (or disease terms) and edges  represent the relationship between the current node and its ancestors.  Then compare the DAG Similarity.
